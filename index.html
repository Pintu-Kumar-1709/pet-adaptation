        <h2><u>Meet jerry</u></h2>
        <p>
          jerry is a well trained doggy and it's behaivour is quite well
          actually. "Man's best friend" is a common phrase used to describe
          domestic dogs referring to their multi-millennia long history of close
          relations, loyalty, friendship, and companionship with humans. The
          first recorded use of a related phrase is by Frederick the Great of
          Prussia. It was likely popularized by its use in a poem by Ogden
          Nash[1] and has since become a common colloquialism. Before the 19th
          century, breeds of dogs (other than lap dogs) were largely functional.
          They performed activities such as hunting, tracking, watching,
          protecting and guarding; and language describing the dog often
          reflected these roles. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, "In
          the oldest proverbs and phrases dogs are rarely depicted as faithful
          or as man's best friend, but as vicious, ravening, or watchful."
          Beginning in the 18th century, multiplying in the 19th and flourishing
          in the 20th century, language and attitudes towards dogs began to
          shift. Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions
          or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal
          and external stimuli.[79] Dogs' minds have been shaped by millennia of
          contact with humans; dogs have acquired the ability to understand and
          communicate with humans; they are uniquely attuned to human
          behaviors.[13] Behavioral scientists thought that a set of
          social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs that are not possessed by
          the dog's canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such
          as great apes, are parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.

          masters very quickly. Training rabbits is very easy. In a Rabbit essay
          in English, we should highlight that they love to play with toys when
          kept as pets. Rabbits show signs of depression when confined in a
          small cage with no toys. They also are famous for hopping and
          exercising in order to stay fit and fine. There are 305 known species
          of domestic rabbits while 13 non-species of wild rabbits in the world.

          vegetables or fruits. They also graze on fresh green grass and
          vegetation. In an essay on rabbits, we should highlight that they are
          very careful when they roam about in an open area. Rabbits are blessed
          with sharp vision and hearing. They can see and sense danger from a
          great distance. Rabbits have long ears. In a rabbit topic, it is
          important to highlight that their eyes can move 360 degrees in order
          to detect danger. They make holes in the ground and stay there to
          protect themselves from danger. When a predator chases them, they
          start running in a zigzag pattern to make the predator tired. These
          holes are called burrows.Rabbits are little mammals with short, fluffy
          tails, whiskers, and long ears. There are over 30 species in the
          world, and while they exist in a variety of settings, they share many
          characteristics. Rabbits are known for their insatiable reproductive
          habits for good reason. They breed three to four times each year.
          Rabbits need a safe environment and protection from hazards, whether
          they live inside or outside the house. The milk of rabbits is highly
          nutritious and among the richest of all mammals. The young grow
          rapidly and most are weaned in about a month.
